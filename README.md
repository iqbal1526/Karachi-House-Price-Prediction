# Real Estate Price Prediction Project

This project is a real estate price prediction system built using machine learning techniques. It predicts the price of a property based on features such as bedrooms, bathrooms, area, and location.

# Dataset
the data set is obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/danishjmeo/karachi-housing-prices-2023?datasetId=3346325 

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a simple web application that allows users to input property details and get an estimated price. The project consists of the following components:

- `housingProject.py`: Python script containing data preprocessing, data analysis, model training, and prediction functions.
- `data.csv`: CSV file containing the dataset used for training and testing the model.
- `app.py`: Flask web application serving as the backend of the project.
- `model.pickle`: Pickle file containing the trained machine learning model.
- `columns.json`: JSON file containing the column names used during training.
- `index.html`: Containing a simple frontend.
